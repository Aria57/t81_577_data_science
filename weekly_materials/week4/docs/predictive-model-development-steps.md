### Learning objective: Explore and familiarize with steps of predictive machine-learning model development on a high level  


### Framing questions:

Understanding and defining the data science problem clearly is the first and most critical aspect in the model building process. Usually, the request for a machine learning based product or solution comes from people who have better grasp on business domain. Engaging with the customers right from the beginning and asking a series of questions will allow data scientists to deliver products according to the need of customers. Formulating and asking right questions will help fully understand the need of business without making assumptions about what others are thinking.

Example of some questions:

- What are the requirements of the problem? 
- What are the assumptions and constraints?
- Is the problem solvable?
- How should the questions be prioritized to derive the most value?
- What resources are available? 
- What risks are there in pursuing the project?
- What are the different data sources, which variables do I need, and how much data will I need to get from each one? 
- How will the results be used? 

### Data collection:

The goal of the step is to gather datasets that can be used to train and evaluate our machine learning models. Having already asked the right questions in relation to the data need, availability, and accessibility makes data acquisition process a lot smoother. However, this step is very critical as the quality and quantity of gathered data will directly determine how good your predictive model can be. The data collection may require integrating data from various sources and possibly involve data augmentation (where existing datasets are enhanced by adding more external or synthetic data). Some teams spend months and months of their time collecting and enriching dataset thinking a machine learning model requires humongous amount of data to work. It pays a lot to remember that the machine learning is an iterative process: quickly testing ideas on the readily available dataset can provide better guidance on the amount and type of data further needed.


### Data Preprocessing:

Raw data rarely comes in a form suitable to readymade analysis. Many data scientists complain that they spend eighty percent of the time gathering and preprocessing data. As quality of the data is one of the main determinants of better model and predictions, it is actually a vital step in the pipeline. Preprocessing steps takes the raw data and transform them into desired shape and quality. The quality of data may suffer due to inaccuracy and inconsistency in data and format and incompleteness in values among other reasons.

- Data type conversion and encoding categorical features
- Correcting inconsistency
- Identifying outliers
- duplicate removals
- Standardization, Aggregation, Binning, Missing value treatments
- Balancing dataset
- Splitting data into train-test-val



### Model fitting and evaluation


### Model deployment

### Performance monitoring and redevelopment
