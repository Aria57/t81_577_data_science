# Assignment  1.2 : AWS Essentials


In this assignment, you will do the following:

- Open an AWS account - 1 Point
- Spin up a free-tier EC2 instance - 2 Points
- Create a S3 bucket - 1 Point
- Transfer a  text file to the newly created s3 repository - 1 Point

Capture screenshots that clearly show the completion of each of the above four steps. Save the files as `aws_yourLastname.png`, `ec2-yourlastname.png`, `s3-yourlastname.png`, `file-yourlastname.png` respectively.

- Upload the files to [OK](https://okpy.org/) by logging in to your student account using your personal gmail. If you haven't sent me your gmail yet to add you as a student there, you can submit the assignment via Canvas.

#### Don't forget to terminate the EC2 instance after finishing the assignment.

_**Note**_ Assignment 1.1 and 1.2 will not be graded using autograder. But assignments from the next week onwards are Jupyter Notebook based, which will be autograded if submitted via OKPY and will save me a lot of work.
