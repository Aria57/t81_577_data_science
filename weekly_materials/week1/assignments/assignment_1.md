# Assignment  1.1

This assignment is very straightforward. Go to the _Installing Python_ section here and follow the instruction to install Anaconda for **Python3** on your computer.

- Once installed, open anaconda prompt and test whether the _numpy_ and _pandas_ library exists by first running the python interpreter and then importing pandas and numpy in the python prompt.

- Check whether _pillow_ library exists, if not, install using conda.

- Take a snapshot of the installation message and upload the file to [OKPY](https://okpy.org/) by logging in to your student account using your gmail. If you didn't send me your gmail to create your account there, you can submit the assignment via canvas.

_**Note**_ Assignment 1.1 and 1.2 will not be graded using autograder. But assignments from the next week onwards are Jupyter Notebook based, which will be autograded if submitted via OKPY and will save me a lot of work.
