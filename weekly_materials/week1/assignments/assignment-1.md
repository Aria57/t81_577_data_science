# Assignment  1.1



### In this assignment, you will install Anaconda, test packages, and start a Jupyter Notebook server.

#### 1. Anaconda installation (Points 3.5)

Go to the _Installing Python_ section here and follow the instructions to install Anaconda for **Python3** on your computer.

- Once installed, open anaconda prompt and test whether the _numpy_ and _pandas_ library exists by first running the python interpreter and then importing pandas and numpy in the python prompt.

- Check whether _pillow_ library exists, if not, install using conda.

- Capture a screenshot that clearly shows successful import of _numpy_, _pandas_, and _pillow_ packages 

#### 2. Jupyter Notebook (Points 1.5)

- Start a Jupyter Notebook server

- Open a new Python3 notebook

- Rename the file as `your-last-name.ipynb`

- Turn the first cell type to Markdown and type `Testing Jupyter Notebook`

- type in the subsequent cell:

```python
print('whatever u like')
```
- Take a snapshot that clear shows the name of the notebook, and the first two cells you played with.

Upload all files with screenshot to [OK](https://okpy.org/) by logging in to your student account using your gmail. If you didn't send me your gmail to create your account there, you can submit the assignment via Canvas.

_**Note**_ Assignment 1.1 and 1.2 will not be graded using autograder. But assignments from the next week onwards are Jupyter Notebook based, which will be autograded if submitted via OKPY and will save me a lot of work.
